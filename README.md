# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
Detect Fraudulent Credit Card transactions using different Machine Learning models and compare performances

In this notebook, I explore various Machine Learning models to detect fraudulent use of Credit cards. I compare each model performance and results. The best performance is achieved using SMOTE technique.

## Problem Statement
In this project we want to identify fraudulent transactions with Credit Cards. Our objective is to build a Fraud detection system using Machine learning techniques. In the past, such systems were rule-based. Machine learning offers powerful new ways.

The project uses a dataset of 300,000 fully anonymized transactions. Each transation is labelled either fraudulent or not fraudulent. Note that prevalence of fraudulent transactions is very low in the dataset. Less than 0.1% of the card transactions are fraudulent. This means that a system predicting each transaction to be normal can reach an accuracy of over 99.9% despite not detecting any fraudulent transaction. This will necessitate adjustment techniques.

### Techniques used in the project
The project compares the results of different Machine learning techniques:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Support Vector Machine
6. K - Nearest Neighbor

#### Context
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

#### Content
The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

#### Inspiration
Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.
