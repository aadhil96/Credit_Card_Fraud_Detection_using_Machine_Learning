# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
Detect Fraudulent Credit Card transactions using different Machine Learning models and compare performances

In this notebook, I explore various Machine Learning models to detect fraudulent use of Credit cards. I compare each model performance and results. The best performance is achieved using SMOTE technique.

## Problem Statement
In this project we want to identify fraudulent transactions with Credit Cards. Our objective is to build a Fraud detection system using Machine learning techniques. In the past, such systems were rule-based. Machine learning offers powerful new ways.

The project uses a dataset of 300,000 fully anonymized transactions. Each transation is labelled either fraudulent or not fraudulent. Note that prevalence of fraudulent transactions is very low in the dataset. Less than 0.1% of the card transactions are fraudulent. This means that a system predicting each transaction to be normal can reach an accuracy of over 99.9% despite not detecting any fraudulent transaction. This will necessitate adjustment techniques.

### Techniques used in the project
The project compares the results of different Machine learning techniques:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Support Vector Machine
6. K - Nearest Neighbor
